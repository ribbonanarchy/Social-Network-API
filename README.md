# Social Network API

Developer: Robyn Arnecke

# Summary 

This is a back-end application that stores user and thought data so that it can be accessed via CRUD operations. Here is a video showing the application's current functionality: https://watch.screencastify.com/v/S3hIdheN8n6BvMiyUwoW

# Development

This application's GET and POST routes are functional at this point, though there are some bugs in the PUT and DELETE operations, which I intend to work on in the future.
